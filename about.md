Hi, I'm wednesday, a CTF player and occasional security researcher.

- Currently I work as pentester at [Mantel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darren-xuan-662911249/).

- I am also a challenge author for [DownUnderCTF](https://downunderctf.com/) and [skateboarding dog](https://sk8boarding.dog/).

- The best way to contact me is through Discord (username: `wednesda_y`).
